**Problem**
Write a method that takes a floating point number that represents an angle between 0 and 360 degrees and 
returns a String that represents that angle in degrees, minutes and seconds. You should use a degree symbol (°) 
to represent degrees, a single quote (') to represent minutes, and a double quote (") to represent seconds. 
A degree has 60 minutes, while a minute has 60 seconds.

Note: your results may differ slightly depending on how you round values, but should be within a second or two of the results shown.

You should use two digit numbers with leading zeros when formatting the minutes and seconds, e.g., 321°03'07".

You may use this constant to represent the degree symbol:

DEGREE = "\xC2\xB0"

Rules:
Explicit
  - Input: floating point number representing an angle between 0 and 360
  - Output: string representing angle in degrees, minutes and seconds
  - Must use degree symbol (°) , (') and (")
  - Minutes and zeros should be 2 digits with leading 0s
Implicit
  - Will have to round the results
  - an input of 0 returns a string equal to %(0°00'00")
  - an input of 360 can equal either %(360°00'00") || dms(360) == %(0°00'00")
  - the degrees does not need leading 0s and can be 1 to 3 digits long

**Examples / Test Cases**
dms(30) == %(30°00'00")
dms(76.73) == %(76°43'48")
dms(254.6) == %(254°36'00")
dms(93.034773) == %(93°02'05")
dms(0) == %(0°00'00")
dms(360) == %(360°00'00") || dms(360) == %(0°00'00")

**Data Structures**
- Floating Point - input - between 0 and 360
- String - output formatted as %(360°00'00") 
- Integer for degrees
- Integer for minutes
- Integer for seconds
- method for formatting integers to strings with leading 0s

**Algorithm**
- Create global variable DEGREE = "\xC2\xB0" outside method
- Create Integer called degrees and set equal to input_float converted to integers
- Create Integre called minutes and set to 0
- Create Integer called seconds and set to 0
- Call method that will use divmod to get remainders and return minutes and seconds
- Combine degrees, minutes and seconds into stringr
- return string



**Problem**
Take a floating point number. Convert everything after the decimal point into Minutes and Seconds.

Rules:
  Explicit
  - Input: Floating point number
  - Output: array with two elements, each an integer
  Implicit 
  - Each integer in the output array should be a max of 2 digits
  - Minutes must be <= 60
  - Seconds must be <= 60
  - 
**Examples / Test Cases**
convert_float(76.73) == [43, 48]
convert_float(254.6) == [36, 0]
convert_float(93.034773) == [2, 5]
convert_float(0) == [0, 0]
convert_float(360) == [0,0] || dms(360) == [0,0]

**Data Structures**
- Glogabl variable for DEGREE
- Global variable for MINUTES
- Global variabe for SECONDS
- Input floating
- Output array with 2 elements each containing an integer between 0-60
- 
**Algorithm**
- Create Float variable called remainder
- Create empty array called minutes_seconds_array
- set remainder equal to the remainder of float generated by calling .divmod on itself with itself as the argument
- Set first element of minutes_seconds_array equal to 60 * the remainder turned into an integer
- save the remainder from previous step and repeat last two steps for seconds
- 


**Problem**
take a number < 0 or greater than 360 and return its degrees in 360 formatted

**Examples / Test Cases**
dms(400) == %(40°00'00")
dms(-40) == %(320°00'00")
dms(-420) == %(300°00'00")

**Data/Algorithm**
-if float is greater than 360 use #divmod to get the remainder of the float divided by 360
-if float is less than 360 use #divmod to get the remainder and subtract that from 360
