Calculator - PEDAC

Process the Problem
  1. identify expected input and output
  2. make requirements explicit
  3 identify rules
  4. Mental model of the problem
  
  Input: 2 Numbers
  Output: 1 Numbers
  
  The problem does not call for a specific type of number. Will try using float as it is more precise.
  The problem does not eliminate 0 as an input. Therefore will need to require outs for 0 errors
  If a user enters something other than a float number, then tell them to try again.
  
  
  Prompt the user to enter their first number and store as float1 . If it is something other than a Float throw error and ask again.
  Prompt the user to enter their second number and store as float2. If it is something other than a FLoat throw error and ask again.
  Prompt user to enter the operation to be performed and store as operation. If other than add, subtract, multiply or divide then throw error and ask again
  Output the calculation of float 1 and float2 using operation.
  
  
Example/Test Case
  TEST 1
  float1 = 12
  float2 = 3
  operation = divide
  output = 4
  
  TEST 2
  float1 = 0
  float2 = 4
  operation = divide 
  output = error, cannont divide zero
  
  TEST 3
  float1 = 11.5
  float2 = 8.6
  operation = multiply
  output = 98.9

Data Structure
 float1 = Float.new
 float2 = Float.new
 operation = String.new

Algorithim
  1. Creata a Float variable named float1 and float2
  2. Prompt user to enter their first value
  3. Check users input to confirm it can be converted to a Float
    -if it cannot throw error and prompt user to enter new Float
    -if it can be converted set float1 equal to the input converted to Float
  4. Repeat steps 2-3 for float2
  5. prompt user to input operation
    -if DOES NOT equal operation equals add, subtract, multiply, or divide throw error and ask user to enter again
    -if it does equal add, subtract, multiply, or divide then set operation equal to its value
  6. display the result of float1 operation float2
