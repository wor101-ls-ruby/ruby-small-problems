# Below we have a listening device. 
# It lets us record something that is said and store it for later use. 
# In general, this is how the device should be used:
# Listen for something, and if anything is said, record it for later use. If nothing is said, then do not record anything.


class Device
  def initialize
    @recordings = []
  end

  def record(recording)
    @recordings << recording

  def listen
    # launch school uses return unless block_given?
    record(yield) if block_given?
  end
  
  def play
    puts @recordings.last
  end
end

# Anything that is said is retrieved by this listening device via a block. 
# If nothing is said, then no block will be passed in. 
# The listening device can also output the most recent recording using a Device#play method.
