# Ben and Alyssa are working on a vehicle management system. 
# So far, they have created classes called Auto and Motorcycle to represent automobiles and motorcycles. 
# After having noticed common information and calculations they were performing for each type of vehicle, 
# they decided to break out the commonality into a separate class called WheeledVehicle. 
# This is what their code looks like so far:

class Vehicle
  attr_accessor :speed, :heading

  def initialize(km_traveled_per_liter, liters_of_fuel_capacity)
    @fuel_efficiency = km_traveled_per_liter
    @fuel_capacity = liters_of_fuel_capacity
  end

  def range
    @fuel_capacity * @fuel_efficiency
  end 
  
end

class WheeledVehicle < Vehicle


  def initialize(tire_array, km_traveled_per_liter, liters_of_fuel_capacity)
    super(km_traveled_per_liter, liters_of_fuel_capacity)
    @tires = tire_array
  end

  def tire_pressure(tire_index)
    @tires[tire_index]
  end

  def inflate_tire(tire_index, pressure)
    @tires[tire_index] = pressure
  end
end

class Auto < WheeledVehicle
  def initialize
    # 4 tires are various tire pressures
    super([30,30,32,32], 50, 25.0)
  end
end

class Motorcycle < WheeledVehicle
  def initialize
    # 2 tires are various tire pressures
    super([20,20], 80, 8.0)
  end
end

# Now Alan has asked them to incorporate a new type of vehicle into their system - a Catamaran defined as follows:

class Catamaran < Vehicle
  attr_reader :propeller_count, :hull_count

  def initialize(num_propellers, num_hulls, km_traveled_per_liter, liters_of_fuel_capacity)
    super(km_traveled_per_liter, liters_of_fuel_capacity)
    @num_propellers = num_propellers
    @num_hulls = num_hulls
  end
end

# This new class does not fit well with the object hierarchy defined so far. 
# Catamarans don't have tires. But we still want common code to track fuel efficiency and range. 
# Modify the class definitions and move code into a Module, as necessary, to share code among the Catamaran and the wheeled vehicles.

# lanunch school solution

module Moveable
  attr_accessor :speed, :heading
  attr_writer :fuel_capacity, :fuel_efficiency

  def range
    @fuel_capacity * @fuel_efficiency
  end
end

class WheeledVehicle
  include Moveable

  def initialize(tire_array, km_traveled_per_liter, liters_of_fuel_capacity)
    @tires = tire_array
    self.fuel_efficiency = km_traveled_per_liter
    self.fuel_capacity = liters_of_fuel_capacity
  end

  def tire_pressure(tire_index)
    @tires[tire_index]
  end

  def inflate_tire(tire_index, pressure)
    @tires[tire_index] = pressure
  end
end

class Catamaran
  include Moveable

  attr_reader :propeller_count, :hull_count

  def initialize(num_propellers, num_hulls, km_traveled_per_liter, liters_of_fuel_capacity)
    self.fuel_efficiency = km_traveled_per_liter
    self.fuel_capacity = liters_of_fuel_capacity

    # ... other code to track catamaran-specific data omitted ...
  end
