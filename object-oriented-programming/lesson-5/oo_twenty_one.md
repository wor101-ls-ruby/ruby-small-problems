Twenty-One is a card game consisting of a dealer and a player, where the participatnts try to get a as close to 21 as possible without going over.

Here is an overview of the game:
- Both participatnts are initially dealt 2 cards from a 52-card deck
- The player takes the first turn, and can "hit" or "stay"
- If the player busts, he loses. If he stays, it's the dealer's turn
- The dealer must hit until his cards add up to at least 17
- If he busts, the player wins. If both player and dealer stays, the highest total wins.
- If both totals are equal, then it's a tie, and nobody wins
-
