## flatten and print this array. That is, the printed result should not have any subarrays, but should have all of the original 
 # strings and numbers from the original array:

 favorites = [['Dave', 7], ['Miranda', 3], ['Jason', 11]]

 puts favorites.flatten     # this returns a flattened array but does not alter the original nested array. To do so use .flatten!
 
 p favorites.flatten
